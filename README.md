# Public Holiday Finder

Public Holiday Finder is a React-based web application that allows users to view public holidays for a selected country. The app fetches holiday data from the [Nager.Date API](https://date.nager.at/) and displays it in a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Country Selection**: Users can select a country from a dropdown menu to view its public holidays.
- **Holiday Sorting**: Holidays can be sorted by date, local name, or English name.
- **Dynamic Data Fetching**: Fetches real-time holiday data from the Nager.Date API.

## How It Works

1. **Select a Country**: Use the dropdown menu to select a country.
2. **View Holidays**: The app fetches and displays the public holidays for the selected country in the current year.
3. **Sort Holidays**: Use the "Sort by" dropdown to sort holidays by date, local name, or English name.
